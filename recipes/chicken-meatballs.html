    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe comes from <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/baked-chicken-meatballs/">Sally's Baking Recipes</a>. These delicious baked chicken meatballs are super <strong>versatile</strong>. They go great w/ marinara sauce or on a meatball sub. The chicken base makes this recipe a really healthy option, and it's really easy to make them in bulk. The meatballs freeze well and can be stored in the fridge for up to 1 week.</p>

        <li>Preheat oven to 400째F (204째C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or spray with nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>With a large spoon or spatula, mix together all the meatball ingredients in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Scoop a portion of the mixture, about 2 Tablespoons (30-35g) in size, roll into a ball with your hands, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining mixture. You should have around 35 meatballs.</li>
